// Directory-name completion for the project picker's "type a folder" input.
//
// Typing `/mnt/hdd/code/current_project/alavera_app` by hand, with no feedback
// until you submit and no way to see what's actually there, is the worst part
// of opening a project that the repo sweep didn't find. This is the smallest
// thing that fixes it: given whatever the user has typed so far, hand back the
// sibling directories that match, so the UI can complete rather than guess.
//
// Deliberately narrow: directory NAMES only. It never opens a file, never
// reports one, and never reveals a file's size or contents — the answer to
// "what's in this folder" is only ever the subfolders you could plausibly open
// as a project.
//
// On scope: this is NOT restricted to `configuredRepoDirs()`. `repoDirs` is
// empty in the default install, so restricting to it would leave the feature
// dead for almost everyone — and this input exists precisely for projects
// living outside the swept directories. The endpoint sits behind the same
// origin/rebinding/token gate as the rest of the surface, which is the real
// boundary; this module's job is only not to widen it.
//
// That reasoning has a limit worth naming. The tempting argument is "the same
// gate already fronts /terminal/pty, which hands out a login shell, so anyone
// who can reach this could already `ls` the machine". True by default — but
// AGENTGLASS_TERMINAL_DISABLED=1 exists, and an operator who turns the shell
// off has deliberately given up that capability. Silently handing it back a
// directory listing at a time would quietly undo their decision, so this gets
// its own switch rather than riding on the terminal's.
