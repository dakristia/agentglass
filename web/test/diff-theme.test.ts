// Worth testing on its own because breaking it is invisible. A theme that
// cannot be registered used to leave `codeToTokens` throwing once per line,
// which the renderer catches and answers with plain text — so the diff came out
// as unstyled monochrome, looking exactly like a file whose language has no
// grammar. Nothing was logged and nothing was shown, so the only way to notice
// was to compare two themes side by side.

// The regression: shiki's default Oniguruma engine is WebAssembly, and
// `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` sets `script-src 'self'` with no
// `'wasm-unsafe-eval'`, so the webview refuses to instantiate it and
// `createHighlighter` rejects before a theme or grammar is ever asked for —
// every diff in the app came out monochrome while browsers were fine. The
// guard is installed at import time rather than inside one test because the
// highlighter is memoized: by the time any single test ran, an earlier one
// would already have built it, wasm and all, and the check would pass
// vacuously. With it here, *any* test in this file that reaches for wasm
// fails.
