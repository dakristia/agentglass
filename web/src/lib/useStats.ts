/**
 * How often to re-poll for a given window.
 *
 * /stats is a set of aggregates over every event in range, so its cost scales
 * with the window — an all-time view over months of backfilled history is a
 * full scan, an order of magnitude dearer than an hour's worth. Polling all of
 * them at the same live-feeling rate meant the widest views spent most of their
 * time re-deriving numbers that had barely moved. A month of history doesn't
 * change meaningfully between two four-second ticks; a fifteen-minute view
 * does, and keeps its rate. The live event feed arrives over the WebSocket
 * regardless, so the panel never looks frozen.
